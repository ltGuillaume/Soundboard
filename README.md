# Soundboard
_Soundboard is a simple mobile web-based soundboard system with the ability to record your own sounds and play them on a remote (party) computer._

#### Included:
- Soundboard web system (can be used as stand-alone system)
- Party client for Windows ([AutoIt](http://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/) script + executable)
- Party client via local HTTP server
- Soundboard+[Festify](http://getfestify.com) Wrapper, in order to let people add to the party playlist of the party PC, while recording and playing soundboard items over that music

#### Dependencies:
- Both clients are made to use [MPV](http://mpv.io/), an MPlayer fork.
- The Windows client is made with [AutoIt](http://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/).
- The optional Soundboard+Festify Wrapper wraps around the nicely done party playlist system [Festify](http://getfestify.com), for which in turn you'll need a [Spotify Premium](http://spotify.com) account.
