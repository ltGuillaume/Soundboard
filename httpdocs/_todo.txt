1) Upload this folder to your server

2) Make sure the following file and folders can be written to by the web server:
		/queue.lst
		/sounds/
		/uploads/

3) Fill the /users/ folder with .jpg files of people's names that will be on the party (lower case only).

4) If the images (SVG's) don't work, add a .htaccess file to this folder with the following line:
		AddType image/svg+xml svg

4) In case you want to use soundboard+getfestify.com-wrapper.htm, you can change the following line:
		<iframe src="http://festify.us"><a href="http://festify.us">Open Playlist</a></iframe>
   to include your party playlist immediately (without entering the party code),
   by going to http://festify.us, entering your party code and then copying the URL in the address bar.
   The resulting line will be something like this:
		<iframe src="http://festify.us/554a9791757e65242d72f15e"><a href="http://festify.us/554a9791757e65242d72f15e">Open Playlist</a></iframe>

2) Copy mpv.exe and mpv.com from http://mpv.io/ to this folder (Windows)

3) Make sure the following file can be written to by the web server:
		/playback.log
